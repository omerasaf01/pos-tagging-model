# Turkish Pos Tagging Model

## How to Build

I used the `uv` package manager to simplify all the steps required to start this project.

```sh
$ uv sync
```

This command will install all the dependencies.

```sh
$ uv run main.py
```

This command will start the project and build an RNN model in the `out/` directory. You can use it in your other projects.
